# ARCHIVED
This repo had no chance unfortunately! The middle of robogames 2024 was super hectic and it allowed zero space for orginization, not that I knew how to properly structure a project back then but still. Either way the repo is still a mess and I don't plan on looking at this again. This will now join the rest of my dead projects that you yourself can find by cyberstalking me! 

# Sparky
Refresh of the Sierra-College-Robotics-Club/Sparky repo for 2024 RoboGames.
